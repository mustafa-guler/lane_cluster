`conda` is a python-oriented environment manager.
While it is primarily geared towards python it can be used for many things.
`conda` packages are pre-compiled for a particular system, so you will not need to deal with compiling your own dependencies.
`conda` environments sandbox dependencies from each other so different environments can exist and be used without polluting the global package space.
