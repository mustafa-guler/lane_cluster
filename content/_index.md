[Slurm Basics](/lane_cluster/slurm-basics/) contains general information about connecting to the lane cluster and interacting with it by submitting jobs.

[Dependency Managmenet](/lane-cluster/dependency-management/) contains descriptions of tools you can use to manage your dependencies on the lane cluster specifically. Most of this is transferable to other clusters as well.
